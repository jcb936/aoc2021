# Solutions for Advent of Code 2021

- Compiled with _g++_ against _C++20_
- Some solutions from the first days are missing because I did not save them properly (oopsie), they weren't _too_ interesting anyway
- Input need to generally be provided through _std::cin_, you can just put the input in a text file, like _input.txt_ and, giving an example on a shell, run:
```
g++ -std=c++20 adv12.cpp -o adv12
./adv12 < input.txt 
```
